# I-O_related_Operations

This Repository includes Various Task related to I/O operations :

1 .Working with Files:
Read a large file efficiently without loading it entirely into memory.
Write to a file concurrently from multiple threads safely.
Implement a file watcher to detect changes in a directory.

2.Byte Streams and Character Streams:
Convert data between byte streams and character streams efficiently.
Use BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream for better performance.

3.NIO (New I/O) Operations:
Use the java.nio package for non-blocking I/O operations.
Implement file or socket channels for asynchronous I/O.

4.Serialization and Deserialization:
Serialize and deserialize complex objects efficiently.
Handle versioning and backward compatibility during serialization.

5.Network Programming:
Create a simple multi-threaded server/client application.
Implement a secure communication channel using SSL/TLS.
Handle different types of sockets (TCP, UDP).

6.Object Streams and Externalization:
Use ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream for object serialization.
Implement the Externalizable interface for custom serialization.

7.Character Set Encoding and Decoding:
Convert between different character sets.
Handle encoding and decoding errors gracefully.

8.Memory-Mapped Files:
Use memory-mapped files for efficient file I/O.
Implement a scenario where memory-mapped files provide a performance benefit.

9.Pipes and Pipelines:
Connect output of one process to the input of another using PipedOutputStream and PipedInputStream.
Create a complex data processing pipeline with multiple stages.

10.Working with Compression:
Compress and decompress data using java.util.zip or third-party libraries.
Implement a custom compression algorithm for a specific data type.

11.Handling Large Data Sets:
Implement streaming data processing for large datasets.
Use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter effectively for handling large text files.

12.Asynchronous I/O:
Use CompletableFuture or other asynchronous mechanisms for I/O operations.
Implement asynchronous file reading and writing.

13.Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:
Implement robust error handling for I/O operations.
Design a retry mechanism for transient I/O failures.

14.Transaction Handling:
Implement transactional I/O operations.
Rollback changes in case of a failure during a series of I/O operations.
